# Changelog

# 1.0.0-beta.1

1.0.0 focuses on getting torii to work on Ember 3.24, Ember 4.0 and up.

## Changes



## Breaking
- To be compatible with Ember 4.x, all implicit injections are removed. This means that you need to explicitly inject the session service, e.g. in routes.
- The set of dependencies is only compatible with Ember 3.24 and upwards
- The addon is only compatible with modern versions of node, with the same rules applied as Ember itself.

# 0.11.0

Project overhaul to adopt modern convetions and remove deprecated usage.
